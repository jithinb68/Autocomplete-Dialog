# Employee Onboard

# Description

The goal is to create a Onboarding page for employers of a organisation. One can select team, employee name and the option to recieve a welcome mail from the modal. Team will be auto populated if the employee is selected based on the data available to us. If the team is selected first then employee list will be filtered to employees available in the team.
